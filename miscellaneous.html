            <li> I was recently thinking about the possibility of uniformly sampling from the set of integers, the set of real numbers and (0,1). Here are two blogs I think is rather informative: 
                <a href="https://www.askamathematician.com/2010/01/q-is-it-possible-to-choose-an-item-from-an-infinite-set-of-items-such-that-each-one-has-an-equal-chance-of-being-selected/">Is it possible to choose an item from an infinite set of items such that each one has an equal chance of being selected?</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/293742190/answer/487399260?utm_psn=1767172369956036608">是否可以等可能地从实数集/正整数集中任意取一个数</a>. 
                Now I've been thinking about nonuniform sampling from the set of integers, clear we can do such thing on the set of real numbers (e.g. Gaussian), can we do something like that on integers? (e.g. set the probability to be geometric series). I really should take some time and read real analysis and something about measure theory based probability...
